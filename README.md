Multiple versions of exams are frequently used to combat cheating. For fill-in-the-blank exams this can require grading each exam separately, even if using AI-enabled software such GradeScope.

To address this problem, I recreated a workflow in Python which re-organized responses on a fill-in-the-blank [question response form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bSTDOz3qsCCJj3j4LgGrWFr-1MMeBhWxQYlJD1DOne4/edit#gid=0) into a single order which I could then upload to my AI-assisted grading software.

A Colab Notebook demonstrating this workflow can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-rybIlkYilo-LPvylT3AInMh7UlnGajM?usp=sharing).  Example exam responses are available on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/brouwern/fitb/tree/main).

The pair of images below shows how this workflow can take a set of exam responses and reorganize them into another order for easier grading.
